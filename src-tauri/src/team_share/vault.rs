//! On-disk format of the team vault and the primitives that read and write it.
//!
//! The vault is a single JSON file on a shared folder. Its header is plain
//! text — format marker, revision counter, KDF parameters and a verifier — so
//! any team member can tell whether their master password is the right one
//! before anything is decrypted. Everything that matters (connection
//! parameters, credentials, groups, tags) lives in `payload`, encrypted with
//! AES-256-GCM under a key derived from the master password with Argon2id.
//!
//! The salt is generated once, when the vault is created, and stays in the
//! header: every member must derive the *same* key from the same password.
//!
//! No file handle is ever kept open. A read opens the file, slurps it and
//! closes it; a write goes to a sibling temp file that is renamed over the
//! target while a lock file is held, and the lock is released immediately
//! afterwards. Nothing in this module holds a handle across an await point or
//! across a user interaction.
